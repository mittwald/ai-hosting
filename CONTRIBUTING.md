# Contributor's guide

This document contains information for contributors to the mittwald AI Developer
Tools. It contains information on how to contribute code, as well as some
general guidelines for development. If you are looking for information on how to
use the tools, please refer to the [README](./README.md).

## General considerations

### Which features should be added to the AI Developer Tools?

There is no hard rule for this, but the following guidelines should be followed.

Features that should (usually) be added:

- Tools that help productivity of developers and make use of AI hosted by mittwald
- Install scripts including setup and configuration

Features that would (usually) not be added:

- Tools which are not able to be used with AI hosted by mittwald
- Complex CLI tools, that should rather be hosted in a separate repository

## Contributing

### Creating a pull request

- Test your setup locally.
- Write docs and extend the readme.

  existing issue.
